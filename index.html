    <h3>So what was it like all the way back in 1950?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Average Cost of new house = $8,450.00</li>
      <li>Which equals 1,940 Pounds Sterling in the UK</li>
      <li>Cost of a gallon of Gas = 18 cents</li>
      <li>Stromburg Black and White Television = $249.95</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      1950 was the start of the fast changes that would be seen in the next 2
      decades , the great depression was becoming a faint memory and families
      were moving out to the suburbs, kids watched howdy doody on 12 inch black
      and white TV sets and spent Saturday afternoons watching cartoons at
      Cinema matinees , times were gentler with little violence and the consumer
      revolution was about to start in a big way, and the man of the household
      became the sole breadwinner. The median family income was $3,300 a year
      and milk was still delivered to the doorstep.
